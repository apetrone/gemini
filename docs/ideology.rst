Ideology
-------------------

This is a collection of everything I've learnt in the
realm of game development. That being said, most of my experience
is based on personal or hobby learning and this entire framework should
be considered "in development".

I want to eventually make games with this, but there are certain aspects
of game creation I refuse to compromise on. I'd rather spend the time to 
work on a better solution to those than create a game.

That being said, the direction on this project may confuse some. 
"Make Games, Not Engines", I hear you cry. Yes -- if my intent was to
create a game, I would be working on that instead. However, I find no
satisfaction in working on a game with a pre-existing toolset or engine.
All the technical decisions have been made for me -- and most are obfuscated
behind a button.

I enjoy working on tech and learning how everything functions. That drives
the direction of this framework and the choices I make. Usually this means
I take a minimalist approach to the problems and increase complexity
when needed.
