World Dimensions
-----------------
The game has 1 unit == 1 meter.

- Stair steps = 18.75 cm tall
- Character = 1.82m tall, .5m wide/deep

Exporting Models
----------------------

The model conversion tool (muse) has direct support for Autodesk's FBX file
format. Any DCC tool which can export to this, is in theory, supported.

----------------------
Exporting from Blender
----------------------
There are some issues exporting from blender, but static geometry
should work. Materials aren't written properly by Blender's exporter.

----------------------
Exporting from Maya LT
----------------------
Maya LT hasn't been tested yet, but I'm sure full FBX support is there.
