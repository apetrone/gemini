World Dimensions
-----------------
The game has 1 unit == 1 meter.

- Stair steps = 18.75 cm tall

Exporting Models
----------------------

The model conversion tool (muse) has direct support for Autodesk's FBX file
format. Any DCC tool which can export to this, is in theory, supported.

----------------------
Exporting from Blender
----------------------
Exporting from Blender is most reliable with the following settings.

[Skeletal Animations]

Version: FBX 6.1 ASCII
+ Selected Objects
+ Animation
+ All Actions
- Uncheck Default Take

NOTES:

	* FBX 7.4 binary mangles the action names

----------------------
Exporting from Maya LT
----------------------
Maya LT hasn't been tested yet, but I'm sure full FBX support is there.
