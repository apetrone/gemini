Roadmap - 2017
---------------------------

Priorities for future developments. Listed in order of descending
priority.


- editor: Asset Pipeline / Processing framework
- runtime: Hot loading shaders (render system v2)
	- pub/sub for asset loading?

- runtime: Oriented Bounding Boxes
- engine: Joint-specific hit boxes


---------------------------
Brainstorming
---------------------------

Ideas or nice to haves I want to learn or integrate.

- editor: separate or integrated?
	* separate
	Pros:
		- Clearly defined boundaries between code and responsibilities.

	Cons:
		- Requires engine/runtime be robust and need to work with live data.

	* integrated
	Pros:
		- Intuitive to work on project, can offer play in editor like functionality.

	Cons:
		- Boundaries not clearly defined.



- deployment system
	- Use itch.io? or Steam? Leverage precache code?
	- How are updates rolled out?
