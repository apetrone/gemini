Roadmap - 2017
---------------------------

Priorities for future developments. Listed in order of descending
priority.


- editor: Asset Pipeline / Processing framework
- editor/engine separation
	Pros of separation:
	- Clearly defined boundaries between code and responsibilities.
		For now, I'm going with a separate engine and editor.
		I'd rather have the clear separation. I'm sure I will come around
		and want an integrated one later, but that's the point. I want to
		run into all of these problems so I can intelligently reason
		one way or the other.
- runtime: Hot loading shaders (render system v2)
	- pub/sub for asset loading?

- runtime: Oriented Bounding Boxes
- engine: Joint-specific hit boxes


---------------------------
Brainstorming
---------------------------

Ideas or nice to haves I want to learn or integrate.

- live updates from Blender

- deployment system
	- Use itch.io? or Steam? Leverage precache code?
	- How are updates rolled out?
