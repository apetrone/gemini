Software Design Philosophy
---------------------------

Without proper direction, entropy takes over and guides us. Design principles
and philosophy enforce a structure which can be followed in an effort to
achieve a central goal.

Rapid Iteration
----------------

Following Boyd's Law of Iteration, "speed of iteration beats quality of 
iteration", this is of great importance to the project.

Semantic Versioning
--------------------
Semantic versioning is used for all tagged versions. See http://semver.org/

Minimalism
-----------

"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."

I extend this philosphy into the software architecture realm. There are many
options these days for external libraries -- which is a testament to how far
software has evolved. However, choosing the best one involves picking the 
smallest, most concise solution that will solve the problem.
